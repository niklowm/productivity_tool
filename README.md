on distractions:
It's important to note that a pomodoro is an indivisible unit of workâ€”that means if you're distracted part-way by a coworker, 
meeting, or emergency, you either have to end the pomodoro there (saving your work and starting a new one later), 
or you have to postpone the distraction until the pomodoro is complete. If you can do the latter, Cirillo suggests the "inform, negotiate, and call back" strategy:
- Inform the other (distracting) party that you're working on something right now.
- Negotiate a time when you can get back to them about the distracting issue in a timely manner.
- Schedule that follow-up immediately.
- Call back the other party when your pomodoro is complete and you're ready to tackle their issue.
